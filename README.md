2. Added footer displaying copywrite, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license line, and Powered By line pointing to the inspiration for the blog layout
3. [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) - type [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text into the `textarea` and the blog post displays as HTML
