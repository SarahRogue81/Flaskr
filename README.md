# Flaskr

Inspired by [Flask's](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) amazing [Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/).

## Changes

1. Used [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for UI
2. Added footer displaying copywrite, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license line, and Powered By line pointing to the inspiration for the blog layout
3. [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) - type [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text into the `textarea` and the blog post displays as HTML
4. Added _[The MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) to the main project so that it's the same license as Flask
5. Added more config variables (with sane defaults) to the `instance/config.py` file (read in `flasker/__init__.py`)
6. Changed font to Raleway for a more professional look
