# Flaskr

Inspired by [Flask's](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) amazing [Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/).

## Changes

1. Used [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for basic UI and ability to change colour themes
2. Used layout UI from [What's the Scoopâ„¢](https://github.com/Woz-U-Group-Projects/team-glampfire-trail-mix)
3. [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) - type [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text into the `textarea` and the blog post displays as HTML
4. Added [_The MIT License_](https://opensource.org/license/mit) to the main project so that it's the same license as Flask
5. Added more config variables (with sane defaults) to the [`flasker/__init__.py`](https://github.com/SarahRogue81/Flaskr/blob/main/flaskr/__init__.py) file
6. Changed font to [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for a more professional look
7. Added footer displaying copyright, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license line, and Powered By line pointing to the inspiration for the blog layout

## Dynamic Blog

To make the Flaskr blog server dynamic, the following variables are set, by default and can be overridden in the `instance/config.py` file:

- `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` &ndash; enables/disables user registration
   - __default__: &ndash; `True`
- `BLOG_LICENSE` &ndash; the name of the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license for your blog
   - __default__: _Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License_
- `BLOG_LICENSE_URL` &ndash; the URL to the License Deed
   - __default__: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)
- `BLOG_OWNER` &ndash; you or the owner of the blog
   - __default__: Pallets
- `BLOG_TITLE` &ndash; the title of your blog
   - __default__: Flaskr
- `SECRET_KEY` &ndash; The Flask secret key which should be changed for production, see the [Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/deploy/#configure-the-secret-key) for further instructions
   - __default__: dev
- `SHOW_LOGIN` &ndash; enable/disable the Login button in the `navbar`
   - __default__ &ndash; `True`
- `W3_CSS_COLOUR_THEME` &ndash; the [W3.CSS Colour Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_color_themes.asp) that you want to use
   - __default__: https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3-theme-w3schools.css

## Installation

Fortunately, installation is very simple.

Get the code from GitHub:

        git clone git@github.com:SarahRogue81/Flaskr.git Flaskr

Setup the Python environment:

        cd Flaskr

        python -m venv .venv

        source .venv/bin/activate

        pip install --upgrade pip

        pip install flask markdown

Initialize the database:

        flask init-db

Configure the blog:

        vi instance/config.py

Run the blog on a dev server:

        flask run --debug

For information on running on a production server, please consult the [_Deploy to Production_](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/deploy/) section of the [Flaskr Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/).

## Online Dev and Hosting environments

There are many to choose from but Flaskr has been setup to be developed and deployed to [Replit](https://replit.com/) as well as [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com).

There's nothing that needs be changed to get this to work on either. The `uv.log` is for Replit and the `flask_app.py` is for PythonAnywhere. Again, this is all setup for you.

Also, GitHub Codespaces is pretty sweet to develop on as well. It's like an online VS Code editor. And with their CI/CD cycle, you can't go wrong for any project.

## Offline Development

You can't go wrong with `vi`. It's the only editor that's 100% guaranteed to be there when you SSH into a server, unlike `atom`. Yes, there's a steep learning curve but at least learn enough for basic editing.

One of my favorites is [Zed](https://zed.dev/). It's super light weight and works on any platform.

And, of course, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works as well. It's big plus is the use of Copilot, which is also on GitHub.

While there are others, my all time favorite Python IDE is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It's AI doesn\'t get in the way and it's easy to use.

## Security

With the `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` and `SHOW_LOGIN` variables in the `instance/config.py` file, it's really easy to lock down this version of Flaskr.

Once registration is not allowed, the following non-Flask commands can be used to manage users:

   - `adduser.py` &ndash; to add a new user
   - `usermod.py` &ndash; to modify an existing user
   - `userdel.py` &ndash; to remove an existing user

And, for passwords, they are auto-generated with a length of 42 characters consisting of upper & lower case characters, numbers, and symbols.

Just copy them into your Password Manager and you're good to go.

If you can't run those commands in production, have a sane `instance/flaskr.sqlite` database file ready and deploy it along with the WHL file. No need to `flask init-db`.
